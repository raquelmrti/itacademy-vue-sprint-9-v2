# ðŸ“– TinyJournal ðŸ“–

A simple and easy-to-use online journal built with Vue and Bulma. Users can sign up, log in, write journal entries, edit them, and delete them. It uses Firebase for the user authentication and Firestore to store the entries. It also uses the Unsplash API to fetch an image for the users' icons.

This is my final project for IT Academy's Vue course, which needed to meet the following requirements:

- Create at least 5 components.

- Use props and events to pass data between components.

- Use Vue routing.

- Use Vuex, with its state, mutations, actions and getters.

- At least one call to an external API.

- Implement "login"/registration, ideally with Firebase, although it can be done with localStorage.

- Protect the routes, either so that there is an admin user who can only see a part of it, or because there are normal and premium users.

- The solution must be well designed and responsive.

- The solution must be operational without bugs, and the mentor should be able to carry out a complete user flow (a specific action for an e-commerce, as an example, would be to carry out the entire purchase process, from entering the website to the payment).
