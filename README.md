# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

## Sprint 9 - Final Project

For this last Sprint I have to make a Vue app with a theme of my choice. There's no exercises, but there are requirements:

- Create at least 5 components.

- Use props and events to pass data between components.

- Use Vue routing.

- Use Vuex, with its state, mutations, actions and getters.

- At least one call to an external API.

- Implement "login"/registration, ideally with Firebase, although you can do it with localStorage.

- Protect the routes, either so that there is an admin user who can only see a part of it, or because there are normal and premium users.

- The solution must be well designed and responsive.

- The solution must be operational without bugs, and the mentor should be able to carry out a complete user flow (a specific action for an e-commerce, as an example, would be to carry out the entire purchase process, from entering the website to the payment).
